# 01-Introduction

Hello!
In this file I am writing code that answers the following questions. 
What is your name?
What is your favorite game?
What concerns do you have about this class?
What are you excited about (in general)?
What is your stackoverflow.com user number?
What is the URL to your github.com profile?

I am doing so as part of a school assignment. The information below is my own and is purposeful in accordance with school assignment guidelines. I am hoping to accomplish the answers to the questions above. I also hope to be able to add something extra to my code.
